# vf-apps-planning
More than one app will be involved in planning in federated economic networks. Planning is complex and variable in many ways: stages, methods, scope, granularity, [algorithms](https://www.valueflo.ws/appendix/overview.html), etc.

Starting with the more tentative stages of planning, some of the apps involved might include:
* [Intents](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/intents.html) (needs, offers, and proposals)
    * Intents could be immediate (I need or can offer this now) or for time span (I generally need or can offer x amount of this over the course of a year).
    * Longer-term intents could be analyzed by something like http://locecon.org which is compatible with VF.
* [Conversations for Action](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/cfa.html), Agreements, [Exchanges](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/exchanges.html), and [Processes](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/processes.html).
* [Recipes](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-apps-recipes).
* [Generating plans from recipes](https://speakerdeck.com/mikorizal/6-nrp-planning-concepts-and-tutorial).
* [Executing the plans](https://speakerdeck.com/mikorizal/7-nrp-do-your-work-tutorial).
